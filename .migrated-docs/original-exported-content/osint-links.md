> I am sure many people that use OSINT are aware of these tools and

> This article tries to cover all the basics that one needs to know to

  - > Hemispheres, Earth’s Axis & Poles

  - > Solar Elevation & Azimuth Angle

  - > Earth has a magnetic field and like all magnets it has two
    > poles, **north** and **south**.

  - > The line joining north and south pole is called **earth’s axis**.

  - > **Equator** is an imaginary line that divides the earth into two
    > equal parts.

  - > These two equal parts are
    > called **northern** and **southern** hemispheres.

> Solar Elevation & Azimuth Angle
> 
> How do you describe the position of the sun in sky at a given time?
> It’s easy, you just need to describe how high the sun is in the sky
> and how *far* it is from the North direction. Finding these values is
> easy.

  - > Let’s say you are standing at a point, **A**.

  - > Find a point on the horizon directly below the sun and call
    > it **B**.

  - > Let’s call the visible center of the sun point **C**.

  - > Now, create a line **AD** which points to North direction.

> 
> The angle between the line **AB** and **AC** is called the **Solar
> Elevation Angle**. It tells us how high the sun is in the sky.
> 
> The angle between the line **AB** (direction of sun)
> and **AD **(north) is called the **Azimuth Angle**. It tells us the
> position of the Sun with respect to the North direction.
> 
> Sun’s Position & Shadows
> 
> We all know how the direction and length of shadows changes throughout
> the day as sun changes it’s position in the sky. Shadows are shorter
> when sun’s above your head in the noon and they become longer at
> evening or in morning when sun is near the horizon. Basic stuff.
> 
> But do you think a shadow of an object in March at 11 AM will have the
> same length and direction as the shadow of the same object in
> September at 11 AM? The answer is, no.

> To understand why it happens, let’s take a look at this GIF which

> 
> The GIF above makes it clear that time of the year affects the angle
> sun rays hit a given place on earth which ultimately affects solar
> elevation and azimuth angles.
> 
> The Two Deductions
> 
> From what we have learned so far, we can make two deductions:
> 
> **Deduction:** If we know the Solar Altitude Angle, we can make a
> guess about the time of the day.
> 
> **Reason:** The length of the shadow changes according to the time of
> the day.
> 
> **Deduction:** If we know the co-ordinates of the object casting the
> shadow as well as the azimuth angle, we can make a guess about the
> time of the year.
> 
> **Reason:** Since the direction and length of the shadow at a given
> time at a given place changes throughout the year, it is possible to
> simulate shadows for the entire year and then pick the one that
> matches the given shadow.
> 
> Using These Deductions in OSINT
> 
> To put what we have learned so far to a test, let’s try to make an

> Our next objective is to find the north direction in photo.

> There’s no definite methodology to do this and improvisation is needed
> based on the content of the photo/video. The technique I am
> demonstrating in this article takes advantage of the fact that
> position and angle of the camera in a photo/video might affect other

**Using Shadows & Sun’s Position for OSINT - Backup**

Wednesday, January 20, 2021

9:00 AM

![Somdev Sangwan 1.3K Followers About Sign in Get started Using Shadows
& Sun's Position for OSINT Somdev Sangwan I hourago 7 min read This
article tries to cover all the basics that one needs to know to do what
the title promises. Here's a list of things we are going to cover in
case you want to skip the basics: • • • Hemispheres, Earth's Axis &
Poles Solar Elevation & Azimuth Angle Sun's Position & Shadows Ded
uctions The Actual Hemispheres, Earth's Axis & Directions northern
hemisphere southern hemisphere North Pole axis equator South Pole •
Earth has a magnetic field and like all magnets it has nvo poles, north
and south. • The line joining north and south pole is called earth's
axis. • Equator is an imaginary line that divides the earth into tvv'0
equal parts. • These t-vvo equal parts are called northern and southern
hemispheres. Solar Elevation & Azimuth Angle How do you describe the
position of the sun in sky at a given time? It's easy, you just need to
describe how high the sun is in the sky and how far it is from the North
direction. Finding these values is easy. 1. Let's say you are standing
at a point, A. 2. Find a point on the horizon directly below the sun and
call it B. 3. Let's call the visible center of the sun point C. 4. Now,
create a line AD which points to North direction. The angle between the
line AB and AC is called the Solar Elevation Angle. It tells us how high
the sun is in the sky. The angle between the line AB (direction of sun)
and AD (north) is called the Azimuth Angle. It tells us the position of
the Sun vvith respect to the North direction. Sun's Position & Shadows
We all know how the direction and length of shadows changes throughout
the day as sun changes it's position in the sky. Shadows are shorter
when sun's above your head in the noon and they become longer at evening
or in morning when sun is near the horizon. Basic stuff. But do you
think a shadow of an object in March at 11 AM will have the same length
and direction as the shadow of the same object in September at 11 AM?
The answer is, no. To understand why it happens, let's take a look at
this GIF which shows the earth orbiting the sun over the course of an
year. As you can see, the earth's orbit is not a perfect circle and
neither the Sun is the center of the orbit which is why it's distance to
the Sun changes over the year. In June, the sun is closest to the earth
and in January, it's the farthest. To add to it, the Earth's axis is
tilted at a angle of 23.5 degrees. Due to this tilt, when the earth is
closer to the sun (in June), sun rays hit the earth in this way: As you
can see, the sun rays hit the Northern hemisphere in June at a higher
angle and for longer time. As we progress through the year this
situation gradually reverses and when it's January, the Southern
hemisphere gets the most and direct sun light and vice-versa. The GIF
above makes it clear that time of the year affects the angle sun rays
hit a given place on earth which ultimately affects solar elevation and
azimuth angles. The Two Deductions From what we have learned so far, we
can make two deductions: Deduction: If we know the Solar Altitude Angle,
we can make a guess about the time of the day. Reason: The length of the
shadow changes according to the time of the day. Deduction: If we know
the co-ordinates of the object casting the shadow as well as the azimuth
angle, we can make a guess about the time of the year. Reason: Since the
direction and length of the shadow at a given time at a given place
changes throughout the year, it is possible to simulate shadows for the
entire year and then pick the one that matches the given shadow. using
These Deductions in OSINT To put what we have learned so far to a test,
let's a-y to make an educated guess about when the following photo was
taken. First, we must know the location where the photo was taken. I
found the exact spot on Google earth and highlighted matching objects to
validate my finding. The coordinates are 41.889695, 12.4912546. Our next
objective is to find the north direction in photo. There's no definite
methodology to do this and improvisation is needed based on the content
of the photo/video. The technique I am demonstrating in this article
takes advantage of the fact that position and angle of the camera in a
photo/video might affect other angles in it but the ratio of those
angles stays the same. So, if a angle X is 2 times bigger than angle Y,
it will always appear 2 times bigger no matter how you take the photo.
Let's get back to the business, scroll up a little and take a look at
the photo above, do you see that circled little pole thingy? Let's call
it point A in our Google earth image. The left most and right most
pillars of the arch point are named B and C, respectively. Also, in
Google earth (and most of other maps), north is directly upwards by
default so we draw a line AD directly upward to represent the north
direction. Next, we measure the ratio of the angles. = 12.010 = 33.040
's. 04/12.01 = 2.92 Angle BAC is Z . times Larger Chan Angie DAS To
replicate this in our original photo, we will do the same things all
over, point A is the pole thingy, point B is left most pillar and point
C is the right most pillar. Next, we draw a line AD such that the angle
DAB is 2.92 times smaller than the angle BAC, this line gives us the
north direction. Next, we will find the Azimuth angle. Remember what is
an Azimuth angle? It's the angle betwveen Sun's direction and North. In
our case, the sun seems to be exactly in the South so the angle Azimuth
angle will be 180'. Remember, sun's direction is always opposite to the
shadow\*s direction. Now is the time for the last calculation, the ratio
betwveen an object and it's length. You can use any unit of length
because we are just calculating ratio. As you can see, the shadow is
1.61 times large the object itself and that's the final piece of
information we needed to know. So, we have this so far: 1. Coordinates:
41.889695, 12.4912546 2. Azimuth Angle: 180' 3. Shadow/ Length ratio:
1.61 Now, we just need to find at what time, the sun vv-ill be 180' from
the north and make shadows 1.61 times larger than objects. To do this,
we will use an amazing online tool: vrnw.suncalc.org. It is a tool that
can simulate sun's position and other related data from a given time and
place. Just enter the location and choose any time of any year, from
there on you can keep changing the month and time of the day until you
get a azimuth angle and shadow length close to your result. Once you are
close, you can start narrowing down and start changing day of the month
and pick the one the produces the closest result. In this case, the
closest match was February 1st-2nd, and 12:20 PM, when shadow length of
is 1.66 (close to 1.61) and Azimuth angle is 179.01 (close to 1800). To
guess the year, you will need to find imagery of the location over the
years and match them against the target photo which isn't in scope of
the article, maybe next time. One last tip that I would like to give is
that if shadow is in south, you are probably in the southern hemisphere
and vice versa. You can play around vvith SunCalc to see what I mean.
That's all for this time folks, hope this helps in your future

> Putting The Conditions To The Test
> 
> So we now have four conditions that we know to be true of the location
> where Tilman is. They are:
> 
> *1. Close to an airport, train line parallel with runway.*
> 
> *2. Flat, rural/semi-rural location.*
> 
> *3. Station on a line that is roughly east-west.*
> 
> *4. Possibly in Belgium, the Netherlands or Germany.*
> 
> To check for locations that match these conditions, we can use Google
> Earth Pro. To make it simple we can disable all the layers in the map
> except for place names, railways, and airports, like this:
> 
> ![](media/image40.png)
> 
> This leaves our target area looking like the image below. The railways

> 
> There are only a few airports, so it will not take long to check them.
> We can strictly apply our true conditions and immediately reject a lot
> of the possible candidates if they do not match all four conditions.
> Düsseldorf airport is next to a railway, but this line runs
> north-south and not east-west so it cannot be right. The same goes for
> Eindhoven, Cologne, Antwerp, and Rotterdam so we immediately reject
> them. Münster-Osnabrück is not near a railway at all, so we can reject
> that too. Amsterdam Schiphol has a railway line nearby that is
> parallel to one of the runways, could that be it?
> 
> ![](media/image42.png)
> 
> Nope. On closer inspection the orientation is impossible, Tilman could
> not look north from this train line and see a plane that is landing at
> Schiphol. A landing plane would be flying the opposite way to the one
> in the video. Schiphol might just meet conditions 2,3 and 4, but the
